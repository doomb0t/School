CS201 ASSIGNMENT 4 INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

In this assignment you will optimize code and get it to run faster using
techniques you have learned in this course.

You will measure code execution time using the Linux time(1) command. This
command prints out three numbers:

    real: total elapsed time
    user: total cpu usage of the application code
    sys:  total cpu usage of the application's operating system calls

For the purposes of this assignment, you will use the user statistic returned by
time(1).

You should do this work on syccuxfas01.pcc.edu. This is where I will be testing
your code, and execution times on this machine are the standard that your code
will be judged by. The fact that your code may have met the timing standard on
some other machine does not count, and will not help you.

The code for this assignment has an outer loop and an inner loop. The inner loop
computes the sum of the numbers in an array (note that the array is initialized
by calloc() to all zeroes). The outer loop repeats the inner loop's computation
the specified number of times. You should maintain this loop structure as you
optimize this code. In particular:

    * you should not alter the outer loop
    * you should not change the size of the array or its data type
    * the array should remain initialized to all zeroes -
        do not change any element of the array
    * your inner loop should still compute the sum of all the elements
        of the array
    * your code should be no longer than 50 lines

The basic idea is to change the contents of the inner loop to make the
computation run faster while having it still repeatedly compute the sum of the
array elements.

Do not write any assembly language for this assignment. You can achieve the
speedup you need at the C code level.

Do not use the optimization features of gcc. I will be compiling your code with
all gcc optimizations turned off. Compile your code with same flags that are
used by the 'gc' bash script in ~michael.trigoboff/bin.

The "Loop Optimization" section of the "Optimizing Code" page of the
"Optimization" lesson demonstrates techniques that may be of use to you for this
assignment. There are code examples of the techniques in

    ~michael.trigoboff/cs201/code/optimize/loopOptimization

Remember that you need to do only one of the versions below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REGULAR VERSION

Optimize the code in a04.c so that it runs in less than 7.0 seconds.

Upload your work as file a04.c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREMIUM VERSION

Optimize the code in a04.c so that it runs in less than 5.0 seconds.

Upload your work as file a04.c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED PLATFORM

I grade your code on syccuxfas01.pcc.edu. Your code is required to compile and
run correctly on that machine.

COMPILING YOUR CODE

You are required to compile your code with the same flags that are used by
the 'gc' bash script in ~michael.trigoboff/bin.

GRADING YOUR CODE

Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code
that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive
zero points.

I use bash scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important
that you submit your code with the file name that was requested. If you change
the file name, my scripts will crash, your work will not be graded, you will
have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.

My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors
(if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then
personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the
scripts don't generate your grade, they just make it more convenient for me to
generate your grade.

TO SUBMIT THIS ASSIGNMENT

Submit the requested file to Desire2Learn.   Make sure that your code prints
your name, assignment description, and number, as requested.

    * Be certain to check that you completed the upload successfully. After you
        click the Upload File button, you must also click the SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT
        button. This is very easy to forget. If you do not do this, I will not
        see your work and you will get a grade of zero for the assignment. I
        would recommend entering an email address so you can be notified that
        the upload was completed successfully.
    * You may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will
        only see and grade the final one. You will not be able to upload
        assignments after the due date.

Points will be deducted for uploading a file with a name that is not as
specified. Every term I get a few students whose approach to following
directions is, shall we say, "creative." I encourage creativity in general, but
there are places where it is not appropriate.
